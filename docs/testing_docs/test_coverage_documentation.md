### Testing Approach
This folder contains a screenshot summarizing our testing process for this project.

We wrote X unit tests for the Data Wrangler module of our package. We did not write tests for the Dashboard Generator module  based on input from Dave on 11/18/2019 that this was "beyond the scope of this class" and not necessary for our final project. Our Data Wrangler module passed all tests and testing achieved X% coverage, as documented below.
