## Data Wrangler

In this directory, the data_wrangler.py script processes climate model and observational datasets (using subcomponents A-D) into processed data files for use in the Dashboard Generator.

Running this script requires access to the google-cloud-based CMIP6 data archive and a cluster computing hub that can handle the size of these large datasets.
ocean.pangeo.io is an analysis hub (accessible by linking to your ORCID) that users can use to run this script.
