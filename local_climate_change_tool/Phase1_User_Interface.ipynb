    "# **Getting Started:**\n",
    "Before running the [climate dashboard](phase2_dashboard_generator/climate_dashboard.ipynb), it is necessary to acquire a set of processed climate model and observation datasets (which are generated by the phase 1 data wrangler; more detail provided in the [component specification](../docs/Component_Specification.pdf)). Users can acquire such data in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A. Downloading processed climate model and observation datasets\n",
    "***This is the best option for most of our target users***, as it allows you to launch the dashboard without navigating a high performance computing system. In this option, you download datafiles that have already been generated by running the data wrangler (current as of December 2, 2019). This works on any platform (your local computer, or high-performance clusters such as ocean.pangeo.io).\n",
    "* **Pros:** Works across all computing systems, avoids using large datasets that exceed the memory requirements of most personal computers\n",
    "* **Cons:** Will not have the most up-to-date climate model and observation data, as it requires the development team to run the data wrangler and upload output as new data becomes available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B. Running the data wrangler module yourself\n",
    "This is the best option for users with some technical background and ability to interact with a high-performance computing system (*note:* anyone who has an ORCID can run this on the geosciences computing cluster such as ocean.pangeo.io). Because raw climate model data is very large, loading datasets and doing calculations across datasets (like calculating the mean across models) is not feasible on most desktops.\n",
    "* **Pros:** Running the data wrangler will automatically incorporate the most up-to-date  datasets on the google-cloud-based Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) data archive, so this option will incorporate the most up-to-date climate model and observation data into the dashboard\n",
    "* **Cons:** Requires access to a high-performance computing system, generates intermediate datafiles that are large in size, takes about 30 minutes to run the data wrangler\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Below, we provide an interface through which users can proceed through either of these two options. To set up your workspace to run the [climate dashboard](phase2_dashboard_generator/climate_dashboard.ipynb), run step 1 below and then either step 2A or 2B, depending on your preference given the option descriptions above.\n",
