# Local Climate Data Tool
This local climate data tool displays the data from CMIP-6 output for historical
and 4 different future scenarios via the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)
described below. The motivation for this tool is to make climate data more 
accessible to people with little to no computing knowledge or background in 
atmospheric science or climate studies. 

### SSPs
Used the Tier 1 - 21st century scenarios listed below ranging from highest to lowest
emission scenarios.

1. SSP5: Fossil-Fueled Development 
1. SSP3: Regional Rivalry
1. SSP2: Middle of the Road
1. SSP1: Sustainability

*See [here](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-1937-2016) for a more detailed explanation.*
### Historical
1. Modeled Historical: CMIP6 historical simulation
1. Observed Historical: data from Berkeley Earth Surface Temperatures ([BEST](http://berkeleyearth.org/about-data-set/))

## User Guide
Install package by cloning this repository then running setup.py in this current directory. 

Created by a team of researchers at the University of Washington. For bugs and
    issues, report them [here](https://github.com/czarakas/local-climate-data-tool/issues).

## Directory Hierarchy
This section describes the set up of the directories in this repository.
**Analysis**: comprises all of the python scripts and notebooks to analyze and
            generate the panel application for interactive visualization of 
            the data.

    1. Examples: contains example code from CMIP6 hackathon
    1. Phase1_ProcessData: files to process the data into a format that
       readable for input into the panel application
    1. Phase2_CreateApp: files to generate the panel application that 
       displays the interactive dash board for user interaction.
                        
**Data**: holds the files containing the data from CMIP6 (scenario models and historical model) 
    and BEST (historical reanalysis data). 
**environments**: contains .yml files for you to install the environment used for
            this project.
```            
conda env create -f OceanPangeoEnvironment.yml
``` 
**docs**: contains documentation and documents required for cse583 class project.

## Future Directions
- Create display map of selected region and surroundings so that users can visualize the scale
	from which this data is coming. Another step is to allow users to interact with the map
	so that the plots update based on latitude and longitude of user's click. 
- We would like to add more variables to this interactive panel as well such as precipitation.
- Add options to visualize seasonal or monthly means
- Incorporate an option to visualize a running mean, 5 year mean, or the like. 
- Use all models that are a part of CMIP6. This package allows you to incorporate more models as
	they are uploaded/added to CMIP6.
